# Important Technical Notes

The default setup generated by the xtext project wizard is not able to compile the PUML grammar due to its size.
A hint on how to fix this was found on [https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1086458/](https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1086458/).
Specifically, you need to extend the `mwe2` workflow with the following settings:
```
parserGenerator = {
    antlrParam = "-Xconversiontimeout"
    antlrParam = "40000"
    options = {
    ignoreCase = true
    backtrack=true
    memoize = true
    classSplitting=true
        fieldsPerClass = "300"
        methodsPerClass= "800"
    }
}
```
